<<PackageHeader(qb_hand_description)>>
<<TOC(4)>>

This package contains the description resources for the ''qbroboticsÂ® qbhand'' device. It includes the [[urdf]]/[[xacro]] model of the hand with its simplified meshes and its configuration setup.

== Launch files ==
The single launch file in this package is a simple test to verify that everything is well configured.

=== qb_hand ===
This launch file calls the template [[qb_device_bringup#description_bringup|description_bringup]] with the default settings to visualize a ''qbhand'' in [[rviz]] (and nothing more).

{{{#!wiki caution
If it does not bringup an [[rviz]] node with the ''qbhand'' loaded inside, something is not working as expected and we recommend to check your configuration (cf. [[Robots/qbhand]]).
