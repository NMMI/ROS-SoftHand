<<PackageHeader(qb_hand_hardware_interface)>>
<<TOC(4)>>

This package is barely usable alone since it provides only the hardware interface for the ''qbroboticsÂ® qbhand'' device.

== API ==
=== qb_hand_hardware_interface ===
This library inherits from the base device-independent [[qb_device_hardware_interface]] (therefore provides the same ROS API) and extends its features specifically for the ''qbhand''. In brief, it provides the specific transmission interface for the hand, which is the only thing that is really device dependent, and exploits the same hardware interfaces properly initialized (cf. [[qb_device_hardware_interface]]), and the same Communication Handler to talk to the physical device (cf. [[qb_device_driver]]).
